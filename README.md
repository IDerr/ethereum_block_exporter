# Ethereum Block Prometheus Exporter

Deeply copied from 31z4/ethereum-prometheus-exporter 
Thanks a lot for his work ! 

This service exports the latest block from Ethereum clients for consumption by [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io). It uses [JSON-RPC](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/JSON-RPC) interface to collect the metrics. Any JSON-RPC 2.0 enabled client should be supported.

## Usage

You can deploy this exporter using the [iderr/ethereum_block_exporter](https://hub.docker.com/r/31z4/ethereum-prometheus-exporter/) Docker image.

    docker run -d -p 9368:9368 --name ethereum-exporter 31z4/ethereum-prometheus-exporter -url http://ethereum:8545

Keep in mind that your container needs to be able to communicate with the Ethereum client using the specified `url` (default is `http://localhost:8545`).

By default the exporter serves on `:9368` at `/metrics`. The listen address can be changed by specifying the `-addr` flag.

Here is an example [`scrape_config`](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/#scrape_config) for Prometheus.

```yaml
- job_name: ethereum
  static_configs:
  - targets:
    - ethereum-exporter:9368
```
